# PT_RXJS - Calling an API & Manipulating Its Data using RxJS Operators
> [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview) is a javascript library that brings the concept of "reactive programming" to the web.

Reactive programming is just a different way of building software applications. Essentially, your software is built to "react" to changes that happen (like click events, data being fetched, etc.)

## Basic Concepts of RxJS
> An [Observable](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) is basically a function that can return a stream of data to an observer over time.

> [Observer](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observer) is there to execute some code whenever it receives a new value from the observable. We connect observable to the observer through subscription using a method called subscribe.

> So, observer can implement (in subscribe method) upto three methods next, error, and complete.

- `next()` will be called by the observable whenever it emmits a new value.
- `error()` will be called whenver observable throws an error. 
- `complete()` is called whenver the observabe is done.
![Observable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100778209/157576466-819f0b12-8bac-401d-a0e1-c43485eb2f96.png)

```typescript

var observer = {
  next: function (value) {
    console.log(value);
  },
  error: function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  },
  complete: function () {
    console.log('Completed');
  }
};

var subscription = Rx.Observable.create(function (obs) {
  obs.next('A value');
  //obs.error('Error');
  obs.complete();
})
  .subscribe(observer);  
```
## Lets implement it in our Angular Project
we are going to call an existing api using [JSON placehoder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) which will return data about Blogs as an observable. 

We will manipulate that data using RxJS operators. Here we will show the final result using subscription.

### Step 1: Scaffolding a new angular application
To scaffold a new angular application. See:

### Step 2: Incorporating Http Client to Communicate with API
To use HttpClient service in angular. See:

### Step 3: Setting up API's Base Url as Environment Variable
To setup Base Url as environment variable in development environment we will simple put it in environment.ts file. 

```typescript

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  baseUrl: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/'
};

```
To understand more about environment configuration. See 9configuring application environment](https://angular.io/guide/build)

### Step 4: Creating a type safe model
API has a function `/posts` that returns a array of object that looks like.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100778209/157579376-36ad32e3-d21a-4b4e-85bb-d4b191cdefdd.png)

To capture this array in type safe manner we will introduce a TypeScript interface matching the same property names as of returned objects.

We will create a folde called `models` to contain all of our models. In it we will create a file called `posts.ts`

```typescript

export interface Blog {
  userId: number;
  id: number;
  title: string;
  body: string;
}

```

### Step 5: Creating a service to fetch data from API
To fetch data from api we will create an angular service Blog Service. We will create a folder called `services` to contain all the services in the application. In this folder we will run the command.

```typescript
ng generate service blog
```

This will scaffold a new service in our application in the file blog.service.ts with following code 

```typescript

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class BlogService {

  constructor() { }
}


```

### Step 6: Using Http Client to call the API
We will dependency inject HttpClient in BlogService to call the api in a function called getBlogPosts. This function will use base url from the environment to construct function url and will use Blog interface to deserialize and return objects into type safe array.

```typescript

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})

export class BlogService {

  // depdendency injecting HttpClient
  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) { }

  // returning type safe Blog array
  getBlogPosts(): Observable<Blog[]> {
    // calling HttpClient get method to call the API
    // contructing the URL using the environment variable and path to the function (i.e., posts)
    return this.httpClient.get<Blog[]>(environment.baseUrl + 'posts');
  }
}


```

### Step 7: Using Blog Service in the component
We will depdency inject the `BlogService` in the AppComponent and call the `getBlogPosts` method in `OnInit` life cycle hook to get the observable.

```typescript
 this.blogService
      .getBlogPosts()
      .subscribe(response => { this.blogs = response; });
```
### Step 8: Using RxJS Operators to manipulate data
> An operator is a pure function which takes in observable as input and the output is also an observable.

#### Pipe
> Itâ€™s a standalone function and a method on the Observable interface that can be used to combine multiple RxJS operators to compose asynchronous operations.

#### Map
> Applies a given function to each value emitted by the source Observable, and emits the resulting values as an Observable.

#### Filter
> Filter items emitted by the source Observable by only emitting those that satisfy a specified condition.

```typescript
  blogs: Blog[] = [];

  constructor(private blogService: BlogService) {
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    // calling the service
    this.blogService.getBlogPosts()
      // filtering the top 10 posts based on criteria using lambda expression
      .pipe(map(p => p.filter(x => x.id < 10)))
      .subscribe(response => {
        this.blogs = response;
      });
  }
```
